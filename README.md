## About this project
* Created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript and hosted through <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>!
* Uses the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest">GitHub REST API</a> to provide automatic updates to the 'Projects' section of the website!
* Includes an option for light mode by clicking the circle icon in the header (however, the website is set to default to dark mode).
* Mobile friendly!

I'm always looking to improve this website (after all, this is version 1.0!) so if you have any suggestions, 
please feel free to suggest them! Thank you so much for checking this project out, and I hope you stop by again!
